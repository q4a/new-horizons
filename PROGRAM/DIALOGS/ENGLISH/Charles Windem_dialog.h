".",
"Wonderful to have you here, ",
". What can I get you today?",
"I need some strong men to help out on my ship. I'd prefer smart, but I'll settle for quiet.",
"I'm hoping you have a moment to talk.",
"I need a room. A clean one.",
"Do have a free pile of straw in this barn?",
"Sorry. I was just on my way out, ",
". I'll see you around.",
"Oh, you'll make sure of it yourself, sir ",
". My name is ",
". I am the owner of this humble tavern.",
"I need to hire a crew, ",
".",
", let's talk...",
"Do you have a room I can use? ",
"I'd like to stay here for a while.",
"I might pay you a visit later.",
"Certainly. What would you like to talk about, Captain ",
"?",
"A friendly fellow like yourself is sure to hear a lot of interesting rumors. I'd like to know what's going around these days.",
"There is something on my mind...",
"Yes?",
", a man named ",
"Ewan Glover",
"Ewan Glover",
" said he'd wait for me here.",
"I need some job. Don't you know any rich boy on this island who is afraid to travel alone?",
"Good day. How may I help you?",
"I'm looking for a young Spaniard. His name is Lucas Da Saldanha. Perhaps you've seen him.",
"You know, ",
", I'll catch up with you some other time.",
"If he is he prefer to sail in with less satellites, you know this.",
"Yes, I forgot. Alright, I'll come back later, when I'll got less ships, ha-ha.",
"I don't want to help you guy, you've done to much troubles to my country",
"Just look at this patriot. Well, goodbye",
"Your hands covered by blood. Don't you seriously think, that somebody will travel with you",
"You are right, everybody afraid of me! Ha-ha!",
"You came right in time, one merchant here was searching for right company to travel, you'd better to talk to him. Here he is, coming in to the tavern now.",
"I'll do that.",
"No, there is nobody for that moment, Maybe next time.",
"Hm, than I will wait.",
"Interesting. By the way, I'm looking to add some strong backs to my crew.",
"I'd like to talk to you, if you've got a moment.",
"Sorry, I'm just leaving, ",
". I'm sure I'll see you again.",
"Please, any time.",
"I need to add some strong backs to my crew.",
"Do you have a moment to talk?",
"Sorry, I was just on my way out, ",
". I'll see you.",
"Yes, as a matter of fact, he was here. ",
"Ewan Glover",
" recently stepped out with some lady or other. If you can stay, ",
", I'm sure he'll be back soon.",
"Thanks. I'll wait here.",
"Oh, this place is generally full of men willing to set sail on the right ship. But it's late now. They'll start wandering in come morning \nMaybe you'd like to rent a room and wait?",
"All right. Do you have a room free?",
"I might just do that, but I've got some other questions first.",
"I do have a room or two. How long do you expect to stay?",
"Until morning.",
"Just 'til tonight.",
"Fine, fine. It'll be 5 piasters.",
"Fair enough. Here you go.",
"That's too rich for my blood. Guess I'll be spending the night in the common hall with the other paupers and skinflints.",
"What do I get for that my own dancing girl? Never mind. It won't be the first time I've spent a night in a tavern hall.",
"I'll think about it.",
"It'll cost you 5 gold coins.",
"Alright, here's your money",
"That's more than I care to pay for a night's lodging. If need be, I'll rest my head on one of the tables here in the tavern.",
"What do I get for that? My own dancing girl? Never mind. It won't be the first time I've spent a night in a tavern hall.",
"I'll give it some thought. Let's talk about something else.",
"Gentlemen, please! Stop this at once, or I shall call out the guard!",
"All right. Relax. I'm leaving.",
"Yes, I remember him. Nice fellow, and a good client - he paid lavishly every time.",
"Do you know where he is now?",
"I'm not sure where he went, but it's possible I can tell you why he's gone...",
"Please do. It's vital that I know!",
"Well, rumour has it the young Spaniard tried to make time with the governor's daughter. I don't know what happened, but he came in here afterwards in the blackest of moods. The very next morning, he and his yacht were gone, and no one here has seen him since.",
"The governor's daughter? The man has good taste, doesn't he? Any chance I could speak with her, or does her father watch her too closely?",
"Oh, you can be sure when he's not watching her, someone in his pay is doing it for him. Well, he has his reasons, doesn't he? She's a fine-looking girl. She does occasionally take a walk outside of town, but she's always escorted by several guards.",
"Those guards shouldn't be a problem - I'm not intending to kidnap her or anything, just ask a few questions. Thanks, Charles, you've been a big help.",
"Ehh, where did they go?",
"Sorry, can you be a little more specific.",
"Have you seen the retired Governor and his daughter Caroline?",
"This way Captain, I'm sure they are waiting for you.",
"Thank you Charles, I'm on my way!",
"Ehh, uhh I can't find them. You have to give me a hint here Charles.",
"Well hehe, there is a shortcut to Woodes Rogers residence if you please step behind the counter Captain.",
"Careful with that little laugh of yours Windem...",
"You again, what are you doing in my private room? Didn't you find them despite of my instructions?",
"For the last time, watch your tongue old man and open the door to the Governors rooms!",
"That door is closed for some reason and besides a little politeness would be welcome.",
"What reason and could you please (or I'll kill you in 2 seconds) open the door?",
"They are going to start some repairs of the entire house today. And no Sir, at this time of the day I have to get some rest from the tavern work.",
"Maybe a little gold could compensate you from this awful trouble",
"It will be 5 gold then.",
"Here you are, hurry and unlock the door now!",
"Hmm, looks like I don't have any coins for the moment, but I'll pay you later for sure.",
"I'm running some business here Captain. Give me the money or the door remains closed!",
"------",
"Do you have any spare empty bottles in the tavern?", 
"Empty bottles? No problem at all Captain, take these!",
"Thank you Windem.",
"Empty bottles? No problem at all Captain, but you need a medicine chest first.",
"I'll be back soon.",
"What's this I hear about some local rich #skid# marrying into Spanish nobility?",
"It's true! ",
" of the merchant ",
", is engaged to the ",
" of the governor of #sSantiago#.",
"Where does ",
" live? I'd like to offer my congratulations in person, maybe also offer my services.",
"Just go through the gate to the next part of the town and you'll be looking right at the house. Big one, looking over the wall to our town hall - you can't miss it.",
"Thanks!",
"Have you heard anything about a #sperson#, specifically #sromance#, being brought into this town by an armed gang?",
"No! In fact, #sromance# was recently married to #svillain#.",
"Married!",
"Yes. I had the job of providing the food and drink for the reception. Mind you, in my job I can tell the difference between a genuine smile and a forced grin, and if #sromance# was happy then I'll eat someone's hat.",
"Yes, that would probably explain why #spronoun# had to be brought here by a gang.",
"Has anything interesting been happening in #sRedmond# lately?",
"Well, there was the marriage of #sromance# to #svillain#. The wedding itself happened in #sSantiago# but there was a reception party here, too.",
"That must have been quite a party!",
"Yes, #svillain# brought in a load of French wine. Don't ask me how he got it, what with the war.\nBut because of the war, a lot of patriotic people didn't touch it, which was good for me because they came here to drink instead.\nMaybe you could pick up the wine on the cheap and sell it somewhere else.",
"Interesting idea. I'll have to see about that. Thanks!",
