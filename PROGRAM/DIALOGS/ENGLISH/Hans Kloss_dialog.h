"I'm just here to pay my respects, #saddr#. Nothing more.",
"In that case, please leave my study and let me get back to more important matters.",
"Yes, of course. Sorry I disturbed you.",
"I'm sorry, but I don't have anything to talk about right now",
"Oh yes? I have a proposition for you, captain.",
"Indeed?",
"I have learned that you completed the task successfully; my congratulations, captain! Here is your reward.",

"I crave forgiveness, your Excellency.",
"I'm interested to learn about #sgov_nation# relations with other nations.",
"I'm looking for a Letter of Marque.",

"Uh, never mind.",
"Very well. But I hope you will reconsider, in time...",
"Goodbye, ",
"Huh?",
"Tough.",
"Indeed? And who is your companion?",
"This is Bonifacius del Agave, a special agent. We believe the ",
", a ship currently moored in your harbour, to be implicated in the abduction of ",
". Normally our own troops would search the ship and arrest her crew, but as she's in your port, we felt it more proper to ask for your assistance.",
"Of course, anything to assist our allies. I'll need to see some proof of your authority, of course.",
"Hmm. There are those among the Spanish court, Governor de la Vega among them, who would like to see Holland once more a dependency of Spain. If I report that you failed to co-operate, the battleships which he will send will probably show our authority.",
"I see. You may tell Governor de la Vega that things have changed over the years, and if he does send battleships, they will be given a very warm welcome by our fort. Now leave!",
"Er...",
"Well, you are certainly more eloquent than your companion. But the same point applies. Can you provide proof of your authority?",
"Now that changes things entirely. Of course I shall be pleased to assist your governor with this matter. Sergeant! Assemble your men. Meet these gentlemen in the port and assist them with their search.",
"Thank you, Excellency. I shall report back when the operation is complete.",
"Well? I take it the search was successful?",
"Yes, Excellency. And I wish to apologise for my earlier outburst.",
"Well, soldiers are not normally hired for their diplomacy. And I am pleasantly surprised by your apology. But where is your companion?",
"He has a prisoner to interrogate. I'll leave the details to your imagination. Thank you again for your assistance, Excellency.",
"The sergeant here has told me how you found #scaptive#. What will you do with the ship and captain?",
"The ship will be impounded and taken to #sSantiago#. We shall leave the English flag flying for now so as not to upset other English ships in #sWillemstad#. Once clear, we shall raise our own flag and return home.",
"Please give my regards to Governor de la Vega. It was an honour to assist in the rescue of his #srelative#.",
"I shall do that, Excellency. It will be my honour to report how important your assistance was in the rescue.",
"Indeed? But you seem familiar somehow. Have you visited me before?",
"No, Excellency. This is my first time in #sWillemstad#.",
"Hmm... I am sure I have seen your face somewhere before.",
"That is a most generous gift. Please give your father my most sincere thanks for it.",
"Let me see... hmm... this looks fair enough. There will need to be further negotiations on details such as prices and tariffs and I shall undoubtedly exchange several letters with ",
" in the near future. But for now, please return to #sSantiago# and tell him that in principle at least, I agree to his proposal.",
"Thank you for your time, Excellency. Come, ",
", we must return to your father with this good news.",
"I do not know who you really are, but attempting to impersonate an officer, even a Spanish one, is a serious offence. Leave now or I shall instruct the sergeant here to arrest you!",
