"Huh?",
"Tough.",
"What do you want, captain?",
"I'd like to talk about your new prisoner.",
"You must be speaking of the man arrested in the brothel yesterday.",
"Let me get straight to the point then. I need to get him out of jail. In a legal way, of course.",
"The punishment for his actions is a two week jail sentence. Why don't you just wait until he is released?",
"Waiting two weeks is not an option. I need to get him out straight away.",
"He didn't commit a very serious crime, so if you are ready to pay me 10000 gold coins, I'll have him released straight away.",
"That is rather much, don't you think, governor?",
"It is a lot, yes, but I need to be sure it is important for you to get him out of jail. If you are ready to pay this sum, that proves it is important to you and if it is important to you, you'll probaby make sure he doesn't end up in jail again.",

"I'd like a pass to visit a prisoner, ",
"That man is a convicted #scrime#, captain. If you are an associate of his then you will probably join him in prison today and on the gallows soon.",
"No, Excellency. But I knew him long ago when we were both boys, and I still keep in touch with his parents. His mother can't travel here and asked me to bring him a message.",
"I see. Well, I can allow such a visit. But you will need to pay 10000 gold as security.",
"That's a lot for just a simple visit.",
"It is security. If you are genuinely a compassionate visitor then you may return here, hand back the pass and 9000 gold will be refunded, so the total cost will only be 1000.",
"Very well. Here is the 10000.",
"Even so, 10000 is a lot of money and I do not have that much with me. If I can raise that amount, I shall return.",
"And here is your pass.",
"Thank you, Excellency.",
"You were unwise to return here, captain. I know of your little escapade in the prison. Guards! Arrest this #sperson#!",
