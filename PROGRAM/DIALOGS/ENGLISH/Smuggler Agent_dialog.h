"'.",
"What do you have for me, captain?",
"A few goods to sell.",
"Nothing. Goodbye.",
"How can I help you, captain?",
"I want to sell something.",
"You can't. Goodbye.",
"Hm... I'm afraid you're mistaken. Go to the store -- they'll gladly buy what you have.",
"I'm afraid a store can't help me.",
"Thanks for the advice. Goodbye.",
"Is that so?",
"I have something no merchant will buy.",
"Maybe you should finish one piece of business before starting another?",
"I guess you're right.",
"Ah, there you are again! Hope you know what you are doing and are willing to take the risks, because the coastguard ships and soldiers don't always work together. I am just warning you that while you may miss the first, the others can still catch you. My friends will wait for a few days at the place called ",
"Hmh... maybe I can help you. I'll find you a customer. But you must watch out for the coastguards! They do not like people helping poor town folk like us. You should find out about their patrols around the island.",
"Okay, thanks.",
". Please don't make them wait too long.",
"Okay, I'm on my way. After all, you have to take risks if you want to get rich.",
" Here is a little something to help you.",
" Let me know when you are ready.",
"The smugglers' guild has put a ban on you. It seems you have done our cause no good. But if you pay ",
" gold coins we will forget this has happened.",
"Forget it, I will try my luck somewhere else.",
"I'm sorry for what I've done. Here is your money.",
"Thank you. This money will support our cause. Please allow me a moment to note this down so that I do not forget.",
"I was wondering if you may be interested in a certain peculiar substance.",
"I see you've got some opium! ",
"We are certainly interested in opiates. Some of our brethren smuggle them to various clients that are scattered all over the Caribbean.",
"Could I get a list of these clients?",
"Here you go. To help you I've also included a book to explain how this opium smuggling works.",
"Thank you very much.",
"I suggest you try talking to a soldier in this tavern, most of them are drunks and will tell you anything. If there are no soldiers here, spend some time in the tavern room, or go and do something else and come back to the tavern later, there might be some here then.",
"I see.",
"Or if any of your officers are feeling brave or foolhardy, you could talk to them and ask them to go and scout the beaches for you.",
"Yes, I could do that, couldn't I? Some of them have more courage than common sense and will volunteer for anything.",
"After you have done that, come back and talk to me. You should do that also if you don't find out the times of the coastguard patrols. Then we can discuss what to do next.",
"Okay, I will see what I can find out.",
"Remember, come back and talk to me whatever happens.",
"Yes, yes, I understand.",
"Do you know the effects of this here opium stuff?",
"Our buyers seem to appreciate its effects very much. Some say it helps them see things better. I used it only once and it just made me very sick. You may wish to consult someone with a more thorough knowledge of medicine.",
"Understood. I'm sure I could find such a person if I would want to. Thanks for the help.",
"I'm sorry, this all sounds too risky for me. I'm afraid I have to cancel the deal.",
"Very well then. I shall be back in a minute.",
"Now what was it you were asking before?",
"So it's your ship they are watching eh?",
"Huh, what are you talking about?",
"Those pesky natives, they showed up today and we couldn't figure out what they where after. But now we see they are watching your ship.",
"And why should you bother?",
"Well it's making our ... uhm ... legitimate business a bit harder. But it might also offer us with some opertunities. If you are interested in those opertunities come talk to me in the tavern. But don't wait to long else the opertunies will have past.",
"Okay, I will think about it.",
"You said something about opertunities. I'm interested to hear more.",
"Ah! Well you see there is someone we know who is very interested in the native people you'll see around. Especially in the weapons they are carrying. He asked us to provide him with 10 Bows. Normally this would be pretty hard because those natives keep their distance and they don't want to part with their weapons. But now we see them all around town so maybe you can get those weapons from them?",
"That doesn't sound to hard. What's in it for me?",
"This sounds very fishy, I think I'll pass.",
"Okay, we will find someone else to do it...",
"Okay.",
"The collector promised a very good price if you are able to deliver them to him before two months have passed. Once you gathered them all talk to me again and I will give you the information on where to bring them.",
"Okay, I'll be back before you know it.",
"I've gathered all the weapons you requested.",
"Wonderfull, now bring them to ",
" at ",
" on ",
" then the deal is finished. There you will also receive your payment.",
"Thanks, I'm on my way.",
"I've noticed you are having some problems with this Thomas O'Reily guy. I've seen him also dealing with native people. I thought you might be interested in knowing that.",
"Thank you for the information. We will handle this with him.",
"My pleasure.",
"Do you know anything about the coastguard patrol schedules?",
"Maybe we do, maybe we don't. I don't feel like I should tell you.",
"We don't know the exact patrol schedules, you have to find those yourself. We do know which islands are patrolled more heavily. Let me put it in your tradebook."
