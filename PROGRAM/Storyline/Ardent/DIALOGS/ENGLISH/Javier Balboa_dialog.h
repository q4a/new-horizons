".",
"My name is ",
".",
"Ah, it's you again. What brings you here this time? ",
"I'd like to talk to you about some business.",
"I'm sorry, but there are things that I have to do.",
"So, why do you distract me from the very important affairs of state?",
"I'd like to talk to you about a small piece of business.",
"I'm just here to pay my respects. Nothing more, ",
"In that case, please leave my study and let me get back to more important matters.",
"Yes, of course. Sorry I disturbed you.",
"I'm listening, ",
".",
"I've heard that your #sgov_kid# has recently got engaged. Would it be possible for me to pay my respects and offer my congratulations in person?",
"I'm sorry, but I don't have anything to talk about right now",
"I'm afraid that won't be possible. #sname# is very busy with studying and can not be disturbed. But I shall be sure to pass on your good wishes, Captain ",
"My thanks. I hope the wedding goes well.",
" has told me of an intruder. Now I find you attempting to kidnap my ",
". Guards, arrest this knave!",
"Not so fast. The guards will probably kill me, but not before I kill the hostage and probably you as well. Or you could let us walk out of here and in due time you'll receive a demand for ransom. If that is paid, ",
" will be returned entirely unharmed.",
"You won't get away with it. I shall hunt you down with all the resources at my disposal!",
"Good for you! Hold onto that thought, it will help stop you from doing something rash. Because right now there's either the sad ending where everyone dies or the happy ending where everyone lives. It's your choice, Excellency.",
"Very well. Guards - stand down, let the villain pass. And you! If any harm comes to ",
", you'll wish you'd been shot right here.",
"Don't worry on that account. Just be ready to pay the ransom.",
"How dare you hold a gun on my ",
"! Guards!",
"Very well, I have no choice but to let you leave. But if any harm comes to ",
".",
"Oh yes? I have a proposition for you, captain.",
"Indeed?",
"I have learned that you completed the task successfully; my congratulations, captain! Here is your reward.",
"My thanks; It was a pleasure to aid you.",
"You must destroy the ",
" vessel ",
"quest pirate",
" menacing the shipping off ",
". If you sink her, I will reward you the hefty sum of ",
" gold. What say you, captain?",
"You shall not hear of her again, that I promise.",
"I'm afraid I can't help you.",
"I crave forgiveness, your Excellency.",
"I'm interested to learn about Spain relations with other nations.",
"I'm looking for a Letter of Marque.",
"Ah, ",
", so good of you to stop by. I'd like to introduce my ",
". She'll come in once we've finished business.",
"I've heard I'm up for promotion.",
"I can no longer serve ",
", your Excellency.",
"I'm through serving ",

" In light of your previous service, ",

"I'll make you proud, your Excellency.",
"You have harmed ",

" does not forget his enemies. Leave at once, or the guards will toss you out on your ear!",
"...",
"You have caused ",
" great harm, captain, but ",
" is willing to overlook your past transgressions...for a price: ",
"Very well, Sir. I accept.",
"A pleasure dealing with you, ",
"And you, your Excellency.",
"You are indeed! Excellent work. Your new rank is ",

" acres of land by order of ",
"Thank you, Sir.",
"Are you sure, ",
" will be sorry to lose your service.",
"Yes, I am.",
" does not take kindly to turncoats, ",
"Uh, never mind.",
"Very well. But I hope you will reconsider, in time...",
"Goodbye, ",
"Huh?",
"Tough.",
"You dare show your face here again?",
"Yes. It's time to discuss ransom for ",
"Or I could have you arrested right here and trade you for ",
"That won't work. I'm a pirate and so are my crew. They'll just pick a new captain - one who has not promised not to harm ",
". The only way you'll see your ",
" again is to pay 100,000 gold.",
"That's impossible! No, let me explain. #sSantiago# is short of money. Why do you think I arranged for the marriage of ",
"? It will bring a great deal of business, and money, here.",
" And the recent loss of a payroll ship to pirates hasn't helped. All I can offer now is 40,000.",
" All I can offer now is 50,000.",
" If you accept then we have a deal. If you refuse then my ",
" is lost to me, in which case you'll be arrested and regret the day you ever laid eyes on #sSantiago#.",
"Your offer is not too bad, all things considered. Very well. Tonight you'll send Grigorio Formoselle to Playa de Sierra Maestra with the money and two guards.",
"Sorry, that's not enough. Try to arrest me and see what happens!",
"How do I know that you won't just take the money, kill Grigorio and the guards, and leave?",
"Because your fort covers the beach. You need to trust me that I'll return your ",
" safely, and I need to trust you that you'll order the fort to hold its fire if I do. Without at least that level of trust, this won't end well for either of us.",
"Very well. We have a deal. Tonight, Grigorio, I shall give you the money to take to the beach. With the escort that you suggested, Capitan. You had better not betray that trust.",
"Till tonight, then.",
"You dare show your face here again? I have been looking forward to this. I have taken fencing lessons from the best masters. Now I shall have my revenge in person!",
"Suit yourself. You're not the only one whose skill with the sword has been improving. Let's end this!",
"Yes, to try to make peace. Please, read this letter from ",
"Hmm... How did you know about the puppy?",
"I didn't. I asked ",
" to include something personal which I couldn't possibly know, as a sign that the letter was written freely and not under any duress.",
"I see. Of course, this ruins my plan for the arranged marriage and the money it would have brought. But if I'd only known that ",
" felt so strongly! Very well, if that's truly what ",
" wants, so be it.",
" wants, so be it. Of course, this does not change your standing with Spain. But for now you may leave in peace.",
"Thank you for your understanding. I'm sure ",
" will be pleased too.",
"I have been given this letter to deliver to ",
"Speak to my servant ",
". He deals with such correspondence.",
"Thank you, Excellency. I shall speak to him now.",
"My warmest congratulations to both of you. But now you're married to ",
", I expect the highest standard of behaviour from you.",
"I won't be joining your navy, but I will try to be worthy of ",
"Good! Now, let us return to the residence. There will be a suitable celebration.",
"I'm sure we'll enjoy it. <Thinks: Joining the crew in the tavern would probably have been more fun, but I'd better keep the father-in-law happy.>",
"Grigorio will show you to the dining hall. Enjoy the reception!",
"Thank you. <Thinks: probably boring people, boring food, and not a drop of decent rum.>",
"Well, #sname#, how did you like the reception?",
"To be honest, the company was not as lively as that which my crew probably found in the tavern, and I'd have preferred rum to whatever gassy wine that was. But the food was superb!",
"Yes, I noticed you dining rather well. And if that had been rum, the amount you drank would have put you on the floor and unavailable. Well, it's late now. I believe you know the way to the bedroom?",
"Yes, though it's a difference to be going there honestly. Goodnight!",
"I trust the night was pleasant for both of you?",
"Yes, thank you.",
"And now to business. By way of a wedding present, I'm pleased to be able to offer you a Letter of Marque on behalf of His Most Catholic Majesty King Carlos II.",
"And now to business. By way of a wedding present, and as you are already in Spain's service, I offer you this sword and armour.",
"Thank you, your Excellency - most generous.",
"Thank you, your Excellency, but I'm afraid I can't accept a Letter of Marque from Spain at the moment.",
"You have returned, and with ",
". But I am surprised. I understood from #sname#'s letter that #spronoun# had chosen to leave me.",
"So! You are back, and with ",
"! What have you been doing to #spronoun#?",
"Well...",
"Well! A pirate with a soft heart?",
"We're not all black-hearted money-grubbers, you know.",
"Out of the question! I can't have my #schild# marrying a pirate. Unless, that is, you are willing to give up piracy, now and forever.",
"Is that all that stands in our way? I'm sure I can find some other way to make a living.",
"No, that's not all. The marriage to the house of Downing was to secure a trade deal which would have brought a lot of much-needed wealth to #sSantiago#. If ",
" is to marry you then that will be lost, so you will need to make up some of the loss. The sum of ",
" should suffice.",
"Can I do those the other way round, Excellency? I know only one way to make that sort of money in a reasonable time.",
"That is not a problem, Excellency. I have that amount already.",
"Not a chance! Sorry, but marrying your #schild# is not worth that much money.",
"I hope you are thoroughly ashamed of what you have done here today. Now get out of here before I decide just how angry to become!",
"I'm not the one using my own child to make money. Goodbye!",
"You could get a Letter of Marque from Spain or any of her allies. If then you confine your raiding to French ships then it is not piracy. But, provided you do not harm the interests of Spain, and I do not learn what you have been doing, then very well. Return when you are ready to accept my conditions.",
"I look forward to returning, then.",
"Well? Have you enough money and are you ready to give up being a pirate?",
"Not yet, Excellency.",
"Here is the money you asked for, Excellency. I hereby end my career as a pirate.",
"Excellent! This will be well spent for the benefit of the town, I assure you.",
"Don't tell the people where you got it. I don't want them treating me like some sort of saint and you don't want them to know you got the money from a pirate.",
"From a former pirate, I hope you remember! And now I must make preparations for the wedding. Have you anyone in mind as your escort?",
"I shan't need an escort, Excellency.",
"No, I haven't picked anyone yet.",
"Have you chosen your escort yet?",
"As you wish. The preparations will take a few days. Go and book a room in the tavern. You'll need to pay for the first night but I'll cover the rest of the cost. Then proceed to the church.",
"Most generous, Excellency. I shall make sure that I am ready for the big day.",
"Aren't you forgetting that you are already married?",
"Oh. Err, yes, well. Sorry about that.",
"What the devil...?",
"Grigorio - get the best physician. No matter the cost, the best! And you - get out there and find who did this!",
"But ",
"... will be cared for. You can do nothing here. But you may be able to do something out there. Now go!",
"If I find the assassin, I'll rip him to shreds.",
"No you won't. We need him alive. He must tell us who hired him and why.",
"I'll try, but if it's him or me that dies, it's him.",
"Well done, soldier. You may go. Now, ",
", you'll be happy to learn that the physician reports the bullet did not hit anything vital. ",
" will recover fully in a few days. What of the assassin?",
"He did not survive the fight, Excellency. But he was carrying this.",
"A ring. So?",
"I'm not sure of its significance.",
"It is the personal signet ring of ",
". I carried its twin when I delivered a letter to ",
"So, ",
" probably hired the assassin. Why?",
"Jealousy, perhaps. If ",
" can not marry ",
", #spronoun# may simply want to prevent anyone else from doing so.",
"I will need to consider an appropriate form of retaliation. In the meantime, ",
" is resting and should not be disturbed. We can find a room for you to stay until #spronoun# is well.",
"Thank you, Excellency.",
"Good morning, ",
". As you see, ",
" is recovered.",
"I am so glad to see that!",
"Hmm... Indeed you did renounce piracy, and England is still our ally. But we have genuine grievance against ",
"Hmm... I can not condone such flagrant piracy against England, which is still our ally. But we have genuine grievance against ",
". I shall issue a Letter of Reprisal which authorises you to engage this specific convoy only. Do not try to use it as cover for attacks on any other English ships!",
"Understood, Excellency. I may attack the convoy but all other English ships are to be left in peace, as are those of Spain's other allies.",
"And ",
"'s safety is your personal responsibility. I probably can't prevent #spronoun# from sailing with you, but if any harm comes to #spronoun#, don't think of showing your face here again.",
"Be assured, Excellency. If any harm comes to ",
", your grief will be matched only by my own, and that has nothing to do with your threat.",
"All this reminds me. I had planned to give you this Letter of Marque as a wedding present, but forgot about it when ",
" was shot. It means you can attack Spain's enemies without being considered a pirate.",
"Thank you, Excellency! I - in fact, we - will put this to good use.",
"Ah, ",
", you are back. Did you attack ",
"'s convoy?",
"We did indeed. ",
" will probably tell you all about it in detail. The short form is, we tracked the convoy to #sWillemstad#. We told the governor you'd sent us to rescue ",
", who we said was a prisoner on one of the ships.",
"And he believed this?",
"He didn't believe me. ",
" was more convincing.",
" persuaded the governor that #spronoun# was a prisoner on one of the ships? I am confused.",
"The good news is that the governor of #sWillemstad# was happy to help.",
"Yes, he probably thinks I owe him a favour. I shall need to write to him to thank him. Since you seized that ship in my name, it would be appropriate if you give it to me, then I can send it to him as a gift.",
"But...",
"Don't feel too bad. You still have the other ships. And their cargoes. You'll still do well out of this.",
"I suppose so. And it will be good to get back to my own ship.",
"What an interesting idea! I shall need to consider what sort of trade could benefit both our colonies, but the principle is certainly sound. I should have something by tomorrow.",
"Which leaves us with the rest of the day off.",
"Good morning, ",
". I have formalised a trade proposal for the attention of Governor #sdutch_gov#. Perhaps you would be good enough to deliver it?",
"Yes, I should be able to do that.",
"Indeed not! We should certainly make this trade offer as soon as possible.",
"I suspect that is not quite what ",
" meant by 'opportunity'. But I have no objection. If #spronoun# proves a capable captain, I may give #spronoun2# other ships to command in future. We shall leave at once.",
"Important business, ",
"We have completed your mission to #sWillemstad#. Your letter, backed up by ",
"'s diplomatic skill, was well received. ",
" will send more communications in future to discuss the financial details but he agreed to the principle of your trade agreement.",
"Excellent! You have both done well. And it seem I was wise to trust ",
" to your care.",
"The care has not been entirely one way. Apart from being a charming companion, #spronoun# has truly proven to be a capable officer.",
"The care has not entirely been one way. #spronoun# has proven to be a most capable officer.",
"However, you do not appear to be in command of that ship. ",
"Please resume command of the ship you seized in #sWillemstad# port, or at least some other Heavy East Indiaman, then we can talk further.",
"You have returned. But where is ",
"I am sorry to have to tell you that #spronoun# has been killed. If it is any consolation, #spronoun# died while valiantly fighting the enemies of Spain.",
"No, it is not much consolation. But I believe ",
" would not want me to punish you, and I will respect that.",
"Thank you for that, Excellency. Truly I am sorry. I can only regret that I was not quick enough to first kill the enemy who instead killed ",
"However, your presence can only remind me more of this tragedy. Now go, please.",
"Yes, of course.",
"Why are you here? You know that I hold you personally responsible for the death of ",
". Now get out!",
". You are no longer welcome in the service of Spain. Now get out!",
"Very well. Goodbye.",
"You continue to plague me with your presence! So be it. From now on Spain regards you as an enemy of the state, to be hunted like a common criminal. Get out before I have the guards arrest you!",
"I'm leaving!",
"I can see by your expression that you have bad news,",
"Excellency, I'm sorry to have to report that ",
" has been kidnapped.",
"What happened?",
" accepted a place as an officer aboard my ship, yet some unknown men managed to grab #spronoun#.",
" wanted to be released at #sIsla Muelle#, which I did, but when I returned to visit #spronoun#, one of the citizens told me how #spronoun2# had been taken by armed men.",
" Have you received a demand for ransom?",
"No, ",
". Your report is the first I've heard that ",
" has been taken.",
"Then the motive wasn't money. And we have no clue as to who is behind it. I shall contact some, er, 'associates' - perhaps one of them will brag about having done it, or perhaps one of them will have some idea who did it.",
"! You are back! You have no idea how worried I was when I learned of your abduction.",
"This is an outrage! I will have to consider a suitable retaliation against ",
"As for your reward for returning ",
" to me, I offer you this sword and armour.",
" to me. I represent His Most Catholic Majesty King Carlos II in this colony and am authorised to grant you amnesty for all past crimes against Spain, as well as a Letter of Marque which will permit you to legally attack any ship belonging to an enemy of Spain.",
" to me. I represent His Most Catholic Majesty King Carlos II in this colony and am authorised to grant you a Letter of Marque which will permit you to legally attack any ship belonging to an enemy of Spain.",
"Thank you, Excellency. The reward is most welcome.",
"! What are you doing back here, and with ",
", who kidnapped you? Has #spronoun# harmed you or threatened you?",
"You have betrayed Spain, you have betrayed #sromance# and you have betrayed me! Now you will pay in full for your treachery.",
"Uh-oh...",
"And thank you for that trust. But now it would probably be best if ",
" remains here at home with you.",
