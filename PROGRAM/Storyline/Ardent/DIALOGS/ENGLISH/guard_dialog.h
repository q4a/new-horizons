"Halt! Who goes there, friend or foe?",
"Friend. Definitely friend.",
"We heard sounds of battle and came to investigate. Are you the captain of this ship?",
"Yes. A couple of the lads came back drunk and started some trouble. They're safely locked up and cooling off now.",
"Good. And you won't mind showing me the ship's papers, then.",
"Certainly, officer. Here they are.",
"Your name?",
"Alférez de Navío Esteban Rovapera.",
"And the ship's name?",
"Fortune.",
"Tonina.",
"I see. That's not what it says here. Drop your weapons, you are under arrest. Don't try to fight - there are more soldiers on the way, and even if you beat them, the fort is alerted to sink this ship if it attempts to leave.",
"Blast! I almost got away with it.",
"Thank you. That seems to be in order. Sorry for disturbing you.",
"Not at all, officer. Thank you for your vigilance. It would be terrible if pirates were to steal this ship while you were on watch.",
"Halt! What are you doing, leaving the residence at this time of night?",
"Perhaps you recognise ",
", who is taking an evening walk. I'm the escort.",
"Very well. Sorry to disturb you.",
"On the contrary, your alertness is commendable. We shall speak well of you when we next see the governor.",
"Halt! ",
" is engaged to be married, and not to you!",
"See this ring? It shows me to be an agent of ",
". Talking of rings, I'm authorised to escort ",
" to search for a suitable wedding ring.",
"In that case, I shall accompany you also. The governor would punish me if I allowed harm to come to ",
", and ",
" would be most displeased too.",
"That won't be necessary. As I said, I have the job of escort, and you should not desert your post.",
"My post is wherever there is risk to the governor or his family. As an agent of ",
", surely you do not object to extra security?",
"No, I suppose not. <Thinks: Too risky to just kill him. Look for an opportunity to get away from him.>",
"You won't find any rings for sale that way! I wonder if you were honest about your purpose with ",
"Sorry. I don't know this town very well, but I'm sure I'll find someone who can sell us a suitable ring.",
" will presumably receive the ring in there. But not today!",
"No, but at least I know where to bring it if that is my next job.",
"The store is the other way. This had better not be a deception - don't try to get ",
" onto your ship!",
"I had thought to try a trader in the port. But you are right, we should try the store first.",
"Did you find anything suitable in there?",
"No. Perhaps a trader near the port can sell us something better.",
"Halt! Where are you going at this time of night?",
"Back to my ship.",
"Who's this with you?",
"...",
"Cabin-boy? Your voice seems familiar - have we met somewhere before?",
"Er... no. <cough> Very well, go to your ship.",
"Thank you.",
"Drop your weapons! You are under arrest for the murder of a soldier going about his duty.",
"Not guilty, the reason being, that wasn't a soldier. Look at his gun. It's not a regulation musket, it's an old wheellock pistol. They aren't made any more, and when they were, only the best gunsmiths could do it. I'll wager not even your commander has a gun like this.",
"That may be, but you'll still need to come with me to the guardhouse to answer the charge.",
"Why don't we see my father-in-law instead? He'll sort this out.",
"I suppose your father-in-law is the governor? Ha ha!",
"Laugh all you want, that's exactly who he is.",
"You're lying!",
"If so, it's a stupid lie. If we go there and I'm lying, he'll do something unpleasantly amusing to me. If you prevent me going there and I'm telling the truth, he'll do something unpleasantly amusing to you.",
"Excellency, this #snoun# is accused of attacking a soldier but claims to be your #srelation#-in-law.",
"The 'soldier' was the assassin, Excellency.",
"Ah, there you are. My men will be here soon, then we can search the ship.",
"Thank you. If we find ",
", you will please arrest the crew. But leave the captain to us.",
"We've searched most of the ship but have not found anything suspicious. Have you found anything?",
"Yes. Allow me to present ",
", #srelation# of ",
". This is who we were looking for. Please proceed with the arrest - but leave the captain to me.",
"No, his sister. He's badly sick and I've been tending to him. A couple of the lads came back drunk and started some trouble. They're safely locked up and cooling off now.",
"Lareina Rovapera, and the captain's name is Alférez de Navío Esteban Rovapera.",
"Can't you see that I'm on duty! Don't bother me.",
"All right, all right.",
"Halt! No unauthorised person is allowed in here.",
"I wish to visit a prisoner.",
"You are only allowed in if you have a visitor's pass. Do you have one?",
"Certainly, here it is.",
"You mean this sort of pass? <You show the soldier a gold coin.>",
"Not yet. I shall go and get one.",
"Who needs a pass when I have a sword?",
"Very well. You may enter.",
"Thank you, soldier.",
"You think to fool me with this blatant forgery? Leave now, before I put you in a cell of your own!",
"It looked alright to me. I'll get a better - er, a real one.",
"Well, the Retired Soldiers Fund could always do with a donation of 5000 of those.",
"Here you are. Enjoy your 'retirement'.",
"I don't have that much with me. Goodbye.",
"Did you enjoy your visit? Your donation only paid for you to get in, of course. A similar donation will allow you to leave.",
"Bad move. If I'd killed you outside, the rest of the guards would have joined in. But here you are on your own.",
"Very well. Aren't you lucky I'm rich and generous?",
"That pass didn't look quite right. I've just remembered that the governor uses blue ink, not black. You can leave but you'll need to pay a fine of 5000 gold coins first.",
"Halt! Where are you going?",
"Shouldn't you show more respect to a sergeant?",
"Sorry, sergeant.",
"I've just told the sergeant about smugglers on the beach. He's not going to call out the guard on my word, of course. So I'm going to show him, then he'll decide how many troops he needs to deal with them.",
"Do you want us to come along, sergeant?",
"Should we check on the prisoner?",
