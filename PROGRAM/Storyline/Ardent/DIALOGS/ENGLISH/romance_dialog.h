"Good day, ",
"Good day to you, too.",
"What are you doing in my room?",
"Come with me if you want to live.",
"What do you mean? Who threatens me?",
"Me, if you don't do what you're told. This is a kidnap. So MOVE, or do I need to draw my sword before you get the point?",
"Very well, I shall follow you. But my father shall hear about this.",
"That is the idea, yes.",
"You aren't looking forward to your wedding, are you?",
"No, ",
" is heartless and sees me as little more than a trophy and a bed-warmer.",
"Then how about if I take you away from all this? I can't promise a life of luxury but at least you won't have to marry ",
"You threatened ",
"He probably wouldn't have co-operated otherwise. If he did, by this time tomorrow he'd be out of a job and possibly worse depending on your father's temper. This way he can claim, truthfully, that I threatened to kill him, and for that matter you. Your father can hardly fault him for helping me then.",
"Well, I don't know what you have in mind, but it has to be better than marrying ",
". I shall do whatever you say.",
"Good. Now, when we go out, act frightened. The next bit depends on anyone we meet being convinced that I'll kill you if they try to stop me. Which I won't, but they must not know that.",
"Help! They're trying to kidnap me!",
"Wrong answer! I'll deal with you later!",
"It's true, soldier. I couldn't sleep so I asked my friend to accompany me for a short walk.",
"You see? Everything is fine.",
"I'm sorry! I was frightened and panicked!",
"The deaths of those soldiers are your responsibility. Don't do that again or I'll kill you before I kill the next soldier!",
"What do you intend to do with me now?",
"I'm not sure yet. For now you'll be my guest aboard ship. Perhaps we can find something to occupy you. See how sea life suits you, then we'll talk further.",
"You will be held as a prisoner aboard my ship while I arrange for a ransom. Pray that a suitable sum is forthcoming.",
"WHAT?",
"Sorry, my dear. You wouldn't have been as helpful if I'd told you the truth.",
"Well, a pirate ship's hold isn't comfortable and I'll need a long bath when I get home. But I was treated well by Captain Ardent and the crew.",
"...",
"Have you reached a decision about me yet?",
"I'm inclined to release you. Is there anywhere you'd like to go?",
"I've become used to having you around. How would you like to join my ship? You'd be an officer, of course.",
"In the time we've been together, I've become very fond of you. Would you consent to marry me?",
"No, I'm still thinking about it.",
"Somewhere well away from #sRedmond# and ",
". Perhaps you would be willing to take me to #sIsla Muelle#?",
"Very well, I can probably find something interesting to do there as well.",
"No, I'm afraid my travel plans for the near future do not include #sisland_Isla Muelle#.",
"I'm not sure I can be of use on a ship, though I'd be willing to learn.",
"What can you do?",
"Well, as the ",
" of a governor, I'm used to ordering servants around. And there was the time when my mother was very ill and I looked after her. Then there's ",
"embroidery and sewing",
"wood carving",
", my favourite hobby.",
"A good commander, then. Very well, you'll be first mate.",
"Experience with medicine and tending the ill? You'll do well as the ship's doctor.",
"A ship is much larger than what you're used to doing, but that hobby could be a good start in repairing damage to the ship.",
"My! This is a bit sudden! From what I've seen, you're certainly better than ",
", but that's not difficult. Please, let me have time to consider your proposal.",
"By all means consider, but please don't take long!",
"Hello, captain! Thank you for getting me away. I'll miss my family, of course, but I'd have been eternally miserable married to ",
". I was about to write a letter to my father explaining that I'm well, so he doesn't worry.",
"That's a good idea. Add something personal, something I couldn't possibly know, so he'll know I didn't force you to write it. Then I'll see about getting it delivered.",
"My letter is written, captain. Please see it reaches my father. I really don't want him worrying about me.",
"I'll deliver it in person. Hopefully when he knows the truth he'll be less inclined to hunt me down.",
"Well, this is it. I'll say goodbye to father for the last time, then I'll leave here forever.",
"That might not be a good idea. If the guards attack, you might be hurt or killed in the crossfire. And there's no knowing what your father will do if he sees you - he might have me arrested and marry you off to ",
" after all. You'd best return to the ship until this is settled one way or another.",
"I can't believe it - I'm here in #sIsla Muelle#, free from ",
", and all thanks to you! I'll probably move to somewhere near the church and residence. Why don't you visit me next time you're in #sIsla Muelle#?",
"I hope you find happiness here. And I may very well see you if my voyages bring me this way again.",
"Hello again, ",
"It's pleasant to see you again. How has life in #sIsla Muelle# been?",
"To be honest, very dull compared to my time at sea.",
"Then how would you like to rejoin my ship? As an officer, of course.",
"Perhaps you would prefer to return home? But you would not need to marry ",
" if you marry me instead.",
"That is sad indeed. But this is where you have chosen to be, so I hope you can eventually find happiness, or at least contentment, here.",
"Hello! Who are you and why are you here?",
"I am ",
" and I have been asked to deliver this.",
"Oh, dear. ",
" grows impatient. #spronoun# has set the date for our wedding.",
"A wedding should be the happiest day of your life, but you do not seem happy about it.",
"Silence! I only brought the letter to get to you. Your father will pay well for your safe return, but only after I've taken you from here, so MOVE!",
"Do not give up hope yet. The letter got me in here. Now I will get you out, but you must play your part.",
"That's not my problem. My job was to deliver the letter. Have you a reply for me to take back?",
"No, I shall need time to compose a letter of reply. And I must talk to my father about arrangements.",
"Very well. I shall tell ",
" that you and your father are making preparations for the wedding. Goodbye.",
"That's not a funny joke. If you were serious, all I'd have to do is call out and a squad of guards would arrive to dispose of you.",
"It's certainly not a joke. Should anyone try to interfere with my plan, I'll kill them. Starting with you, if you don't start co-operating.",
"Good. I shall leave now, but each night, look out of your window and one night you will see me out there.",
"What will you do?",
"First you will open that window - and then stand back quickly! About ten seconds later, an arrow will come through. A cord will be tied to the arrow, and a rope to the cord. You will pull up the rope and tie it to something secure - that bed, for example.",
"But I can't climb down a rope!",
"I didn't expect you could. I'll climb up, tie the rope to you and lower you down, then climb back down. With luck we can be away before anyone notices.",
"It sounds dangerous. But if it gets me away from ",
", I am willing to try anything!",
"That's the spirit! Just keep your hopes up, and your eyes down on that street.",
"You're right, it was a joke, perhaps in poor taste. But you seem unhappy about your engagement. Perhaps I can offer an alternative?",
"It's not your lucky day, is it? Because before you can get married, your father is going to have to pay me a lot of money for your safe return. MOVE!",
"It's true. I want a really pretty one which will make everyone jealous!",
"But I am also instructed not to spend too much, so don't be too fussy.",
"Are you really looking for my wedding ring?",
"No. See that ship over there? Run for it, NOW!",
"You enter my bedroom again, ",
"Hopefully for the last time. Now, are you ready?",
"But of course. Tie the rope and lower away!",
"Spoken like a pirate! Who knows, perhaps we'll make one of you. Take this cloak, we don't want the guards at the port recognising you. And... down you go.",
"This is exciting!",
"Shh! We don't want to attract the attention of the guards. Follow me.",
"Just a cabin-boy, sir.",
"If so, you've been a very naughty boy. You don't want your wife to find out, do you?",
"We should board your ship quickly before that guard remembers where he heard me before.",
"Why? And how did you know he's married?",
"He was one of the guards on duty at a garden party hosted by my father a few weeks ago. His wife was there - unusual for a soldier of the ranks. She was probably making sure he wasn't showing interest in any of the ladies present.",
"Jealous, was she?",
"Let's just say that by the looks of her, that guard is probably a man with serious marital problems and does not want any more.",
"And that was some fine thinking and quick talking on your part! But it looks as though he's remembered you after all - run for the dock!",
"Well, this is it, #sname# - our first night together married. How intimate!",
"Yes, dear.  But I can't help feeling that we're being watched. It's as if someone is looking over my shoulder...",
"I am sorry, but I can not marry someone who is an enemy of Spain. But perhaps if you were not an enemy of Spain?",
"Unfortunately my argument with Spain runs deeper than my love for you.",
"Well, if that's what's standing in our way, then I shall speak to a governor to make peace with Spain. There are plenty of other nations whose ships can be raided!",
"I am flattered, but how can I be sure that you truly love me?",
"There are many wonders at sea. The twinkling stars at night and the gleam of the sun on the waves by day. But none match the light of your eyes.",
"Why, how charming! I had not considered that a rough sea captain could be so poetic.",
"I did rescue you from marrying ",
". Does that not count for anything?",
"You did, but before committing to marriage I have to know that I am not just exchanging one heartless blackguard for another.",
"I saved you from a tragic marriage. I brought you to #sIsla Muelle#, asking nothing in return. Now, when you are again unhappy, I return for you.",
"There is a saying, 'If you love something set it free, if it returns then it is yours'. You have set me free, and now you have returned. My heart is yours.",
"Perhaps a token of my affection will persuade you?",
"That worthless thing? If that is the best you can offer, I would be better off marrying a street beggar!",
"Oh, how thoughtful! Truly you care for me to offer me something like that.",
"So now you will marry me?",
"Certainly, if you have a wedding ring.",
"Would this lucky ring do the job?",
"Perhaps this silver ring would suffice?",
"This emerald ring looks fine already and could only look finer upon your finger.",
"I can not give you the whole sea, but perhaps the sapphires in this ring would do?",
"That is the sort of ring which I could expect from ",
". I had hoped you were better, but perhaps I was mistaken after all.",
"What a pathetic piece of rubbish! Find someone dull to match that dull thing!",
"Well said! I look forward eagerly to the day when you place it on my finger in church.",
"I would not need the whole sea. When we are married but you are away at sea, I would only need to look at this to remember you.",
"If it were my decision alone, I would agree at once. But I can only marry you with my father's blessing.",
"Then let us return to #sSantiago# and seek it.",
"Let me explain, please. Father, I was terribly unhappy at the prospect of marrying ",
", so when ",
" offered to take me away, I took the chance at once. I was afraid that I was about to be kidnapped but even that was better than marrying ",
"To be brutally honest, at first I did intend to kidnap you. But when I learned of your plight, I couldn't do it.",
"We became attracted to each other and now ",
" has proposed marriage.",
"With your permission, Excellency, that is.",
"Oh! You foul betrayer! And I thought you were better than the average pirate, but you're no better than the worst of them!",
"Life can be tough sometimes. So can I.",
"You're really going through with this? I am so happy!",
"As am I. See you in church!",
"Don't you dare talk to me again. Don't even come near me!",
"Fine.",
"Have you managed to make peace with Spain?",
"Yes, so you need not worry about betraying your country. ",
"Not yet.",
"Wonderful! Then you'll marry me?",
"Would you care to join my ship as an officer?",
"Would you do me the honour of marrying me?",
"Then I shall have to think of something else.",
"What have you in mind?",
"May this cross bring you good fortune, and bring us together in the church it represents.",
"Perhaps this silver brooch will earn your favour, and your hand?",
"What I have in mind is to win your heart by having you wear this gold brooch close to it.",
"The emeralds in this pendant will turn other ladies green with envy when they see you wearing it.",
"Well, I don't know - perhaps this little collection of gems?",
"How about this fine cutlass?",
"This light tizona has already seen me through several battles. Imagine what you could do with it.",
"This tizona is a superb example of Toledo craftsmanship. In your hands it can only lead to valiant action.",
"This cup-hilt rapier is one of the most impressive swords I've ever seen, and I've seen plenty. You're the only person to whom I'd consider giving it.",
"Sorry about that. Perhaps I'll find something better.",
"You are too demanding! Forget it, I'll find someone else.",
"If that's the way you feel, then goodbye, and may I never see you again as long as you live!",
"If that's the way you feel then I shall leave your ship next time we dock, and you wont have to worry about my 'demands' any more!",
"Goodbye and good riddance!",
"I am sorry, but I can not be an officer on a ship which is an enemy of Spain.",
"That is understandable.",
"And thank you for dealing with the would-be assassin, ",
". Now I have a special favour to ask.",
"Now we're here, I have a special favour to ask.",
"Ask away and if I can, I'll do it.",
"When ",
" was trying to court me, #spronoun# spoke often of a convoy which would make #spronoun2# very rich.",
"When I was in ",
"'s cell, #spronoun# taunted me with talk of a convoy which would make #spronoun2# very rich.",
" It should be at #sOxbay# soon. I would so like for you to take that convoy, ",
", and for me to be there when you do.",
"I'll have to think about it...",
"Of course, it was wrong of me to...",
"Alright, I've thought about it. Let me get this straight. I get to hit a convoy. It makes you happy. And it punishes ",
" for what #spronoun# did to you.",
"Well, that's one way of putting it, yes.",
"Best offer I've had for ages. The only problem is that I had to renounce piracy when I married you.",
"Best offer I've had for ages.",
"Then you'll really take me on the hunt for the convoy?",
"Yes. But I don't run a passenger ship. You'll have to join the crew - as an officer, of course. ",
"How do you intend to take the convoy, ",
"As the #sspouse# of ",
", you'll board one of the ships. I'll be your chaperone. At night I'll knock out the deck guards, allowing our men to come aboard and take over the ship.",
"You wear this cloak and will take the role of an inquisitor. I'll pretend to be a Spanish officer. We're going to persuade the governor of #sWillemstad# to provide troops to assist in rescuing a certain ",
", who is believed to be a prisoner on the ship.",
"I'm interested to see how you intend to do that! But give me a few moments to prepare myself, then I'll join you.",
"Don't be too long. We have a convoy to catch!",
"Quick, get back to the ship!",
"I hope they didn't see me!",
"What's the trouble?",
"I recognised some of the men on that ship. They're the ones who abducted me!",
"So?",
"Don't you see? They'll know I didn't marry ",
" willingly. They'll know something is wrong if they see me here.",
"Alright, we'll have to try something else.",
"What else have you in mind?",
"Gentlemen, if I may? <To you>You, be quiet! I'll deal with you later.",
"!",
"<To governor>As my colleague was trying to say, somewhat crudely, the ",
" is indeed believed to be responsible for the abduction of ",
". His Excellency ",
", governor of #sSantiago#, would consider it a favour and honour if you were to provide troops to carry out the search and, if necessary, arrest.",
"Naturally. This letter should provide the proof you require.",
"?",
"And now?",
"Now you remove your cloak, then I report to the Dutch sergeant that I have just discovered you aboard the ship.",
"We'll need to get a crew for the ship we've just taken. And you need one of our officers to look after our own ship. Who have you in mind?",
"I'm still thinking about it.",
"Not me, please! Don't send me away when we're so close to achieving what we came all this way to do.",
"Very well, I'll pick someone else.",
"So, who is going to look after our ship?",
"If I understand correctly, you plan to steal one of the convoy ships, then attack the rest of the convoy from within. If so, we'll need to berth or sell all our companion ships first.",
"Good point! Let's go to the shipyard.",
"We still can't go ahead until you've disposed of our ships, ",
"Of course! Back to the shipyard, then.",
"This is it, then. We've joined the convoy. When we're clear of #sisland_Curacao# we attack.",
"Correct. But about a couple of things back there with the governor. 'Be quiet, I'll deal with you later'?",
"Your attempt appeared to have failed. It was all I could think of to placate the governor.",
" But if I have offended you, perhaps this is suitable payment? <kiss>",
"More than adequate. In fact, I owe you some change. <kiss>",
"Hee-hee-hee!",
"What's so funny?",
"That governor took you for a Spanish officer and me for an inquisitor. Imagine him seeing us now!",
"Ha-ha-ha! But the other thing was, where did you get that letter?",
"Fair enough. But where did you get that letter?",
"I wrote it. I have a de la Vega family signet ring, of course. And we have never before had contact with #sWillemstad# so the governor has never seen my father's handwriting.",
"You're becoming quite the rogue, aren't you? Piracy, or at least privateering. And now forgery. You're certainly proving your worth as my officer! Now, let's get on with the convoy.",
"Perhaps we could take advantage of this goodwill between you and Governor #sdutch_gov#? I was to marry #svillain# as part of a trade deal, which is now lost. But could we create a deal with #sWillemstad# instead?",
"And perhaps I could take the #sship# to #sWillemstad# to present to Governor #sdutch_gov#? You can provide an escort in your ship so I shall be perfectly safe.",
"Er... yes, of course. If you feel confident enough to take your own command, that is.",
"I have learned much aboard your ship. And I shall be happy to return to her! But this opportunity can not be allowed to slip by.",
"Could you sell or berth one of your ships, please? I can't place the #sship# under your protection until you do.",
"Of course! I didn't have time to visit the shipyard earlier. Let's go there now.",
"I still can't sail along with your ship until you have made room for me in your fleet, ",
"True enough. Very well, back to the shipyard.",
" was good enough to escort me here, Excellency. I bring thanks from my father for your part in my rescue. In gratitude he sends you the ship from which your soldiers freed me.",
"As well as his personal thanks, this letter contains a proposal for a trade agreement between our two colonies. Please read it. I hope it meets with your approval.",
"Such flattery! But I have certainly learned much from sailing with you, and look forward to our next voyage.",
"And I too look forward to returning to sea with you beside me.",
"Yes, there's gold aplenty out there for the both of us. Let's go and get some of it.",
"I noticed that we have a quantity of silk. Would you mind if I took some of it?",
"Not at all. What do you want with it?",
"Don't take any of that! We need to keep the cargo as it is.",
"You'll see. It will be a surprise!",
"Just don't waste it. That's valuable stuff.",
"How do you like this outfit? It is more practical on deck than my dress, anyway.",
"Very nice!",
"Oh, ",
" I am so glad to see you! Can you open this door?",
"Unfortunately I don't have a key so opening that door may take a while.",
"That corridor leads to the house of ",
". There must be a key in there somewhere.",
"Alright, wait here - well, you don't have much choice in that! But hopefully you won't be stuck here for much longer.",
"That lock doesn't look too complex, I should be able to pick it easily enough.",
"Did you get a key?",
"No, but I got the next best thing, a lockpick. And that lock doesn't look complex, so I should be able to open it easily.",
"Thank you! Now we shall settle this. Follow me!",
"Hey, where are you going? Oh well, it's probably better than going back through the dungeon...",
" sent a gang to kidnap me! I was forced to marry #spronoun#. When I would not sleep with #spronoun#, ",
" put me in that cell. I said a lifetime in that cell was preferable to one night in bed with #spronoun#.",
"And now, where is ",
"We should go to the church now. Marriage is supposed to be by consent, but I had no choice. If we explain this, perhaps the priest will release me from the marriage.",
"Very well. The church is just around the corner.",
"Which I will gladly pay if it helps end this hateful marriage!",
"It was ",
"! I had thought myself to be safe ",
"in #sIsla Muelle#",
"on ",
"'s ship",
" but ",
"'s thugs found me anyway. They took me to #sRedmond#, where I was forced to marry #spronoun#. When I refused to consummate the marriage, I was locked in a prison cell, where I would probably still be if not for ",
"I have an idea for that. It will require ",
"'s help.",
"What have you in mind, ",
"Seeing this island makes me long to be among Spanish people again, even for only a little time. May I go into town by myself for a while?",
"I don't see why not. Just be back here before the ship sails, ",
"No, father. #spronoun# rescued me! I couldn't stand the idea of sleeping with ",
", so #spronoun# locked me in a prison cell. ",
" freed me and brought me home.",
"And you promised to pay me for doing so.",
"We could, but #sSantiago# is not rich, so the reward would not be very great. But while I was in the cell, ",
" taunted me with talk of a convoy which would make #spronoun2# rich. It should be due in #sOxbay# soon. Wouldn't you like it to make you rich instead? All I ask is that I am there when you take it.",
"Hmm... small reward now, or a bit of piracy and a big payoff? Alright, you've got a deal.",
"Perhaps we could take advantage of this goodwill between you and Governor #sdutch_gov#? Now that #svillain# has lost both me and the convoy, the trade deal which should have been sealed by the marriage is almost certainly now lost. But could we create a deal with #sWillemstad# instead?",
"Have I done something wrong? I had hoped to continue sailing with you.",
"No, you have done nothing wrong. But your father left me in no doubt that if anything unpleasant happened to you, something unpleasant would happen to me. Now you are home and safe, I would be foolish to risk that again.",
"Very well, then I wish you well on your further voyages. Goodbye, ",
"Very well, then I shall play the part of a dutiful wife and remain here to await tales of your further adventures. Goodbye, ",
"Goodbye, ",
"! I thought I recognised your foul stench above the odours of this place. Have you come to gloat at my further misfortune?",
"What are you talking about? I was told there was something valuable in here. Instead I find you. Perhaps this wasn't a wasted effort at that. Would there be a reward for releasing you and taking you home?",
"If money is what you love then that's what you'll receive.",
"Alright, you have a deal. ",
"I have a confession. I may have misled you. You won't be rewarded for taking me home. I'll probably be sent back to #svillain# and Father probably hasn't forgiven you for kidnapping me.",
"WHAT! I should have left you to rot.",
"But remember what I said - if money is what you love then that's what you'll receive. And that is true.",
"What sort of trick are you planning now?",
"None - at least, not on you. ",
" Wouldn't you like it to make you rich instead?",
"What's the catch?",
"Me. You'll take me with you, and I'll help you find the convoy, starting by telling you where it is due to enter the Caribbean. I'm not interested in the money, only in depriving #svillain# of it. But I want to be there when you do.",
"Alright, you have a deal. Where is this convoy supposed to be?",
"It should be arriving in #sOxbay# very soon.",
"That just earned you a place on my ship. But it's no passenger vessel, you'll have to earn your keep. ",
"I recognised some of the men on that ship. They're part of ",
"'s gang!",
" And if you want to keep your own ship, you will need to berth it here.",
" Remember to berth your own ship, too.",
