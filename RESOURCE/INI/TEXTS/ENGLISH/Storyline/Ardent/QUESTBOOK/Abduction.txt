title=Abduction
text.t1=#sromance# has been kidnapped again, and not by me this time! One of the citizens of #sIsla Muelle# told me that #spronoun# had been grabbed by a gang. The soldiers were useless, and if the gang had their ship at a beach then nobody will have seen #sromance# being taken aboard. I should return to #sSantiago#. Perhaps the governor has received a ransom demand.
text.t2=Governor #sgovernor# has not received a ransom demand. So, no motive for the kidnap, and no clue about the kidnapper. Perhaps one of my former mates at #sTortuga# can help.
text.t3=Governor #sgovernor# has not received a ransom demand. So, no motive for the kidnap, and no clue about the kidnapper. Perhaps one of my former mates at the smuggler camp on #sisland_Conceicao# can help.
text.t4=I had a hard time convincing Governor #sgovernor# that I haven't kidnapped #sromance# again. And he hasn't received any ransom demand. I only got out by saying I'd try to find #sromance# and bring #spronoun# home. If I really intend to do that, maybe my mates at #sTortuga# can give me a clue - perhaps one of them did it!

text.t6=I have to break #spirate# out of the jail in #sPointe a Pitre# on #sisland_Guadeloupe#.
text.t7=The prison is right next to the town gate! If the ship is moored at the beach at Anse Casse-Bois, then after breaking out #spirate# we can just run for the jungle.
text.t8=I can probably get a visitor's pass from the governor.
text.t9=I can probably get a visitor's pass from the governor. Or perhaps that forger back in #sGreenford# could provide one.
text.t10=I bought a visitor's pass from the governor of #sPointe a Pitre#. I don't think it would be wise to return to try to get my 9000 gold refunded!
text.t11=Now we can get out of here. Hopefully the guards won't recognise #spirate# in his new uniform.
text.t12=I bought a fake pass from #sforger#. It was expensive enough! But it looks convincing.
text.t13=I bought a fake pass from #sforger#. It was a quick job and didn't cost much. I hope it will fool the guards.
text.t14=In return for rescuing #spirate1#, #spirate2# has told me that #sromance# was seen being brought into #sRedmond# by an armed gang.
text.t15=Now I know the motive for the kidnap. #svillain# has married #sromance#, probably against #sromance#'s will.
text.t16=Apparently the house of #svillain# used to belong to the Spanish Inquisition and its cellar was their prison. And #sromance# was seen being taken into the dungeon next door, which may have a hidden passage to that prison.
text.t17=I found #sromance# in #svillain#'s prison! But I'll need a key to open the cell door.
text.t18=#sromance# is free. I should take #spronoun# home to #sSantiago#. But first, as the marriage between #sromance# and #svillain# was definitely not by mutual consent, perhaps the church can be persuaded to do something about it.
text.t19=As consent was not freely given, the marriage can be annulled. This will take some time. But the process has started.
text.t20=#sromance# is back home. Now to hit back at #svillain#...
text.t21=#sromance# has been kidnapped again, and not by me this time! Apparently #spronoun# was spending some shore leave in a tavern and was taken by a gang pretending to be sailors from my crew. I should return to #sSantiago#. Perhaps the governor has received a ransom demand.
