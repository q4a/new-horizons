title=Kidnap
text.t1=The #sgov_kid# of the governor of #sSantiago# has just got engaged to the #smerch_kid# of a rich Englishman in #sRedmond# and he's giving out free drinks to celebrate. If he's rich enough to afford that, perhaps he can also afford to pay for his #sgov_kid#'s safe return. I need to do some scouting - perhaps talk to the governor, or look for a useful window.
text.t2=There's a window round the side of the governor's residence, on the upper floor. The wall does not look practical to climb, let alone trying to force the window while clinging onto the wall. But there may be a way to use it, so keep that window in mind for future...
text.t3=The governor won't let me near his #sgov_kid# #sname#, who apparently is too busy studying or something. I'd have to kill the guards at night and pick the lock, though this would be highly dangerous. Or I could visit #sRedmond# to find out more about the English merchant and his #smerch_kid#, then perhaps a more subtle approach will become apparent.
text.t4=As we left the residence, the guards challenged us. I was able to escape but had to leave #sname# behind. So much for kidnap. Perhaps I should stick to good honest piracy.
text.t5=#sname# is now a guest in a cabin on the ship. I haven't yet decided whether to take #spronoun# to some port or other, or possibly recruit #spronoun# as an officer.
text.t6=#sname# is now a prisoner aboard the ship. The governor had better pay a decent ransom otherwise I will need to find some other way to make money out of this...
text.t7=#sname# is dead. Ah, what could have been...
text.t9=The governor failed to offer a suitable ransom. #sname# remains my prisoner. The usual way of ransoming captives will probably yield even less. Perhaps the slave market...
text.t10=The governor offered a reasonable ransom - not as much as I'd demanded, but a good haul considering he's pleading empty pockets and arranged #sname#'s marriage as a way to fill them. Selling his own child - he's worse than me! I need to be at Playa de Sierra Maestra tonight to conclude the deal.
text.t11=That went well! #sname# is back home and I'm a lot richer. Time to move on - #sSantiago# won't be a healthy place to be, and anyway I've probably taken everything I can from there. Perhaps I can find something interesting to do in #sRedmond# tavern...
text.t12=#sname# has agreed to join my crew as an officer.
text.t13=I've decided to release #sname#, who wants to be taken to #sIsla Muelle#.
text.t14=#sname# has given me a letter for the governor explaining that I did not kidnap #spronoun#, I rescued #spronoun# from an unhappy marriage. Hopefully the governor will be understanding otherwise I will need to fight my way out of there when I deliver the letter.
text.t15=I delivered the letter. The governor was surprisingly understanding. Perhaps he feels guilty about the way he was going to use #sname# to get himself some money, almost as bad as me if I'd gone ahead with the kidnap as planned.
text.t16=#sname# is safely in #sIsla Muelle#. Perhaps if I return, we will meet again...
text.t17=#sname# seems to find life in #sIsla Muelle# a bit dull - not surprising compared to the voyage there. However, this is where #spronoun# chose to be, so #spronoun# will just have to make the best of it.
text.t18=One of the good people of #sSantiago# gave me a surprising piece of intelligence. The governor's #sgov_kid# is not at all happy with the arranged marriage. Perhaps I can use that to my advantage.
text.t19=The merchant is #smerchant#, who lives just the other side of the town gate from the #sRedmond# town hall.
text.t20=I've been asked to deliver a letter from #svillain# to #sromance#.
text.t21=I couldn't deliver the letter in person. The governor's servant insisted on taking it. Should I tell the truth or pretend I did deliver it myself?
text.t22=That could have gone better. #svillain# didn't believe me for a moment. So much for the subtle approach...
text.t23=Sometimes the truth pays! #svillain# knew full well I wouldn't get to #sromance#. Because I was honest about it, he paid me and now I have another letter to deliver, along with a ring identifying me as an agent of #svillain#. Those ought to get me where I need to be...
text.t24=The second letter has set the date for the wedding. #sromance# does not seem happy about that, but it's none of my business. Time to return to #svillain# and get paid.
text.t25=Well, that's that. The payment was a lot more than for the first letter. #svillain# wanted the ring back but it just looked like a trinket anyway, so I didn't argue.
text.t26=I've come up with a plan to get #sromance# out of the residence. At night #spronoun1# will open the bedroom window, I'll shoot an arrow with cord and rope tied to it, #spronoun1# will pull up the rope and tie it to something, then I'll climb up and lower #spronoun2# down before climbing back down myself.
text.t27=Who would ever have guessed it? I have actually become fond enough of #sromance# to propose marriage!
